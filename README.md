Project Title: Plant Disease Classification: A Supervised Approach to Dataset Analysis using AI


Overview:

Recent data from the UNFAO indicates that plant pests and diseases lead to the annual loss of up to 40% of food crops, impacting global food security and agriculture. UNFAO Director General QU Dongyu emphasizes the need to elevate the global profile of plant health for the transformation of agrifood systems. In the case of Pakistan, where agriculture constitutes 24% of the GDP and employs nearly 40% of the labor force, it is the backbone of the economy (Pakistan Bureau of Statistics). Plant diseases in the country result in significant crop yield losses, estimated at 10%-15% annually, according to the Finance Division of Pakistan. In response to these challenges, we aim to develop an AI-assisted Plant Disease Classification system, with a primary focus on Dataset Analysis and CNN Models Optimization. This transformative application aims to empower farmers by providing an effective tool for early disease detection and classification. The multi-step process involves a comprehensive analysis of diverse plant disease datasets to construct a versatile dataset capturing variations among various crops and diseases. The AI implementation then optimizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) through feature extraction, PCA dimensionality reduction, and classifier implementation. In an optional final step, we aim to design a user-friendly application with an intuitive interface for uploading images of diseased plants, incorporating LLM for prediction descriptions and potential solutions. Our approach includes visualizing crucial aspects such as the SVD decomposition of the dataset, convolutional filters, and activation maps. Our strategy is designed to provide farmers with timely and precise information, ultimately enhancing overall crop management practices and yields, potentially making it a revolutionary solution in the agriculture sector— possibly becoming a unicorn with a valuation exceeding $1 billion.


Following are the planned deliverables:

•	Merging various datasets to create a larger and more diverse labeled data

•	Analyze the dataset

•	Train deep-learning CNN models

•	Feature visualization, activation map, and other feature aspects of the dataset

•	UI/UX design and integrate LLM (optional)
